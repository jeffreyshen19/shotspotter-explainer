          section.step In 2012, the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority, in partnership with police, <a href = "https://www.shotspotter.com/news/gunfire-down-26-percent-in-kansas-city-areas-covered-by-shotspotter-following-transit-police-partner/">installed</a> ShotSpotter in a 3.55 square mile section of the city (shown in red)—around 1% of the city's total area. Though the installation was initially funded by a federal grant, maintaining the ShotSpotter system now <a href ="https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/reckoning-with-shotspotters-ambiguous-roi/595417/">costs</a> the city around $200,000 annually. 
            p.has-text-grey.mt-2.is-size-7 ShotSpotter coverage area has been approximated based off ShotSpotter activation data as the official coverage area is not public.
          section.step Let's zoom in.
          section.step Based off data obtained by Motherboard via <a href = "https://www.muckrock.com/foi/kansas-city-331/shotspotter-data-kansas-city-police-department-111302/">public records request</a>, there have been 9,649 ShotSpotter activations between January 1, 2016 and April 1, 2021 (around 5 activations daily on average). The map shows their locations. 
          section.step These locations are anonymized to nearby intersections, so some points represent multiple ShotSpotter activations. Here, each point’s size is proportional to the number of activations at that location, to get a better sense of the scale. 
          section.step Though not all activations result in police deployments, this data suggests that ShotSpotter results in multiple deployments of armed police every day to a small area of around 16,000 people, of whom over 75% are Black.
          section.step Therefore, ShotSpotter increases the potential for deadly police violence between armed cops who believe (often falsely) that a shooter is in the area and a majority Black population. 
          section.step As the abolitionist Jackie Wang <a href = "https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/carceral-capitalism">wrote</a> about PredPol, another algorithmic technology which directs police to supposed crimes: “When the Cleveland police officer Timothy Loehmann arrived on the scene on November 22, 2014, it took him less than two seconds to fatally shoot Tamir Rice, a twelve-year-old black boy who was playing with a toy gun. This raises the question—if law enforcement officers are already too trigger-happy, will the little red boxes that mark temporary crime zones reduce the reaction time of officers while they’re in the designated boxes?”
          section.step Tragically, ShotSpotter has already resulted in the <a href = "https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/549612-police-technology-under-scrutiny-following-chicago-shooting">police killing</a> of Adam Toledo, a 13-year-old Hispanic boy who was shot—with his hands in the air—five minutes after police were notified by ShotSpotter of potential gunshots in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago.
          section.step While ShotSpotter is usually placed in so-called “high risk” areas, the placement of gunshot detectors in Kansas City doesn’t correspond to the area with the most violent crime. Here's a map of the violent crime rate in 2017 by census block group.
          section.step ShotSpotter's coverage area has violent crime rates higher than the city average, but with the exception of one block group, rates are below 145 violent crime incidents per 1,000 people. 
          section.step On the other hand, some areas to the Northeast of the ShotSpotter coverage area have higher violent crime rates. For instance, the highlighted block group has a rate of 274 violent crime incidents per 1,000 people.
