This technology is often marketed as a way for police to reduce gun violence, provide faster medical assistance, and prosecute alleged perpetrators. However, numerous activists and journalists have shown that gunshot detection increases police contact and violence, particularly in Black and brown neighborhoods,<sup><a href = "https://www.vice.com/en/article/88nd3z/gunshot-detecting-tech-is-summoning-armed-police-to-black-neighborhoods">[1]</a><a href = "https://www.thecity.nyc/2020/7/5/21312671/shotspotter-nyc-shootings-fireworks-nypd-civil-rights">[2]</a><a href = "https://theintercept.com/2021/04/13/chicago-police-killing-boy-adam-toledo-shotspotter/">[3]</a><a href = "https://southsideweekly.com/end-the-citys-shotspotter-contract/">[4]</a></sup> is inaccurate,<sup><a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/opinion/gunshot-death-doctors.html">[5]</a><a href = "https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/courtroom-testimony-reveals-accuracy-of-sf-gunshot-sensors-a-marketing-ploy/">[6]</a><a href = "https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2018/05/31/silvon-simmons-rochester-police-shotspotter-attempted-murder-officer-cleared-charges/659848002/">[7]</a><a href = "https://endpolicesurveillance.com/">[8]</a><a href = "https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/public-safety/shotspotter-sensors-send-sdpd-officers-to-false-alarms-more-often-than-advertised/">[9]</a><a href = "https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/crime/article59685506.html">[10]</a><a href = "https://www.wnyc.org/story/311533-gunshot-detection-sensors-newark-result-17-arrests-over-three-years/">[11]</a></sup> and ultimately fails to address the root social causes of gun violence.<sup><a href = "https://southsideweekly.com/end-the-citys-shotspotter-contract/">[12]</a></sup> Recent investigations have also shown that gunshot detection data has been falsified and used by police to convict people—with minimal evidence.<sup><a href = "https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-algorithm-technology-police-crime-7e3345485aa668c97606d4b54f9b6220">[13]</a><a href = "https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8xbq/police-are-telling-shotspotter-to-alter-evidence-from-gunshot-detecting-ai">[14]</a></sup>  </p><br><p>The largest provider of gunshot detection technology is ShotSpotter, a publicly traded company with an annual revenue of over $45 million as of 2020.<sup><a href = "https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/02/25/2182925/0/en/ShotSpotter-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results.html">[15]</a></sup> ShotSpotter currently partners with over 100 cities in the continental U.S. such as New York City and Chicago, as well as cities in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and South Africa.<sup><a href = "https://www.shotspotter.com/cities/">[16]</a></sup> The company continues to add partnerships with other municipalities and has begun expanding into fields such as predictive policing and big data,<sup><a href = "https://www.shotspotter.com/law-enforcement/patrol-management/">[17]</a></sup> making it critical to understand the spread and use of ShotSpotter systems.</p><br><p>In this article, I explore another hypothesis for how ShotSpotter is used: to facilitate the gentrification of neighborhoods suffering from gun violence by making them “safe” for investment through increased policing.

Though the installation was initially funded by a federal grant, maintaining the ShotSpotter system now <a href ="https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/reckoning-with-shotspotters-ambiguous-roi/595417/">costs</a> the city around $200,000 annually. <p class="has-text-grey mt-2 is-size-7">ShotSpotter coverage area has been approximated based off ShotSpotter activation data as the official coverage area is not public.</p></section><section class="step">Let's zoom in.</section><section class="step">Based off data obtained by Motherboard via <a href = "https://www.muckrock.com/foi/kansas-city-331/shotspotter-data-kansas-city-police-department-111302/">public records request</a>, there have been 9,649 ShotSpotter activations between January 1, 2016 and April 1, 2021 (around 5 activations daily on average). The map shows their locations. </section><section class="step">These locations are anonymized to nearby intersections, so some points represent multiple ShotSpotter activations. Here, each point’s size is proportional to the number of activations at that location, to get a better sense of the scale. </section><section class="step">Though not all activations result in police deployments, this data suggests that ShotSpotter results in multiple deployments of armed police every day to a small area of around 16,000 people, of whom over 75% are Black.</section><section class="step">Therefore, ShotSpotter increases the potential for deadly police violence between armed cops who believe (often falsely) that a shooter is in the area and a majority Black population. </section><section class="step">As the abolitionist Jackie Wang <a href = "https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/carceral-capitalism">wrote</a> about PredPol, another technology which directs police to "crimes": “When the Cleveland police officer Timothy Loehmann arrived on the scene on November 22, 2014, it took him less than two seconds to fatally shoot Tamir Rice, a twelve-year-old black boy who was playing with a toy gun. This raises the question—if law enforcement officers are already too trigger-happy, will the little red boxes that mark temporary crime zones reduce the reaction time of officers while they’re in the designated boxes?”</section><section class="step">Tragically, ShotSpotter has already resulted in the <a href = "https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/549612-police-technology-under-scrutiny-following-chicago-shooting">police killing</a> of Adam Toledo, a 13-year-old Hispanic boy who was shot—with his hands in the air—five minutes after police were notified by ShotSpotter of potential gunshots in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago.</section><section class="step">While ShotSpotter is usually placed in so-called “high risk” areas, the placement of gunshot detectors in Kansas City doesn’t correspond to the area with the most violent crime. Here's a map of the violent crime rate in 2017 by census block group.<p class="has-text-grey mt-2 is-size-7">"Violent crime" is not an exact or unbiased approximation for gun violence; however, gun violence data in Kansas City is partially sourced from ShotSpotter data, meaning it is inherently skewed.</p></section><section class="step">ShotSpotter's coverage area has violent crime rates higher than the city average, but with the exception of one block group, rates are below 145 violent crime incidents per 1,000 people. </section><section class="step">On the other hand, some areas to the Northeast of the ShotSpotter coverage area have higher violent crime rates. For instance, the highlighted block group has a rate of 274 violent crime incidents per 1,000 people. </section><section class="step">This is not an argument that ShotSpotter “should” have been deployed in a different part of the city, but rather is important to illuminate the motivations behind the placement of ShotSpotter. </section><section class="step">In particular, ShotSpotter was deployed in Kansas City as part of a project extending one of the city’s express bus lines. According to <a href = "https://www.vice.com/en/article/88nd3z/gunshot-detecting-tech-is-summoning-armed-police-to-black-neighborhoods?utm_source=pocket_mylist">Motherboard</a>, ShotSpotter’s service area was chosen to provide the “highest amount of coverage to the areas most densely and heavily traveled by the public transit lines.” As shown on the map, ShotSpotter’s coverage area intersects two express bus lines: Troost MAX and Prospect MAX. </section><section class="step">The deployment of ShotSpotter must be seen in concert with ongoing efforts by the city government and private business interests to redevelop and gentrify areas east of Troost Ave corridor. The map shows Troost Ave.</section><section class="step">Historically, Troost Ave <a href = "https://www.kansascity.com/news/your-kcq/article251695313.html">sharply divided</a> an affluent white community, on the west of the street, and a majority Black community on the east side. This segregation was enforced by racist policies such as redlining, restrictive covenants, and disinvestment, a form of spatial apartheid so successful that the street has been <a href = "https://www.troostvillage.org/about/history/">referred</a> to by some as the “Berlin Wall of Kansas City”. </section><section class="step">These divisions persist today. For instance, educational attainment and housing values remain higher on the west side of Troost and the area remains segregated, as can be seen in the map.<p class="has-text-grey mt-2 is-size-7">Data from 2019 ACS 1-Year estimate.</p></section><section class="step">Given this racist history, it is no coincidence that ShotSpotter is located nearly entirely east of Troost Ave, in an area that has some census block groups which are only 1% non-Hispanic white and over 96% Black. </section><section class="step">In recent years, Kansas City has attempted to redevelop areas east of Troost Ave. For instance, the local government has <a href = "https://data.kcmo.org/Land-Use/Urban-Renewal/k25n-6b98">designated</a> multiple “urban renewal areas”—areas designed to “encourage investment and assist in the removal of blight and blighting conditions”—which fall within ShotSpotter’s coverage area (as shown on map).</section><section class="step">Moreover, the Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, a membership organization <a href ="https://www.kcchamber.com/who-we-are/member-directory">representing</a> large companies like T-Mobile, Honeywell, and H&R Block, are currently working on redevelopment initiatives in four <a href ="https://www.kcchamber.com/what-we-do/big-5-initiatives/revitalize-urban-neighborhoods">focus areas</a>: 31st & Prospect, 31st & Troost, the Ivanhoe Neighborhood’s 39th Street Corridor, and UNI’s Wendell Phillips Neighborhood. All these areas, except for Wendell Phillips, are within ShotSpotter’s coverage area. </section><section class="step">While some of this redevelopment has been well-intentioned and has brought community benefits—for instance, the expansion of public transit—the effect has largely been the gentrification of neighborhoods east of Troost and displacement of the Black population. </section><section class="step">For instance, between 2013 (a year after ShotSpotter was deployed) and 2019, some block groups within ShotSpotter’s coverage area have seen median gross rent increases of over 118% (from $294 to $642). The rate at which rents have risen east of Troost Ave far outstrips Kansas City’s overall rate, where rents increased by 24% between 2013 and 2019 (from $785 to $979). The map shows percent change in median gross rent. <p class="has-text-grey mt-2 is-size-7">Data from 2013 and 2019 ACS 1-Year estimate.</p></section><section class="step">Along with these rent increases has predictably come displacement. In 2015, Kansas City had an overall eviction rate of 5.36%, meaning around 5 of every 100 renter homes faced eviction. However, most block groups in the ShotSpotter coverage area had eviction rates surpassing this average, with two blocks that had a nearly 20% eviction rate—some of the highest rates in the city.<p class="has-text-grey mt-2 is-size-7">Data from <a href = "evictionlab.org">Eviction Lab</a>. There is <a href ="https://shelterforce.org/2018/08/22/eviction-lab-misses-the-mark/">evidence</a> that the Eviction Lab undercounts data, meaning actual displacement could be higher. </p></section><section class="step">Moreover, Black residents are being displaced throughout the Troost corridor. The map shows the change in percent of Black residents between 2013 and 2019. In many parts of ShotSpotter’s coverage area, the percent of Black residents has dropped dramatically, and in one block group, the percentage of Black residents dropped over 41% (from 100% to 58.6% percent). <p class="has-text-grey mt-2 is-size-7">Data from 2013 and 2019 ACS 1-Year estimate.</p></section><section class="step">In ShotSpotter's coverage area, Black residents have largely been replaced with white residents. The map shows the change in percent of white residents between 2013 and 2019, and many block groups with percent decreases in their Black population have seen corresponding large increases in white population.<p class="has-text-grey mt-2 is-size-7">Data from 2013 and 2019 ACS 1-Year estimate. </p></section></div></div><div class="columns is-centered" style="padding-top: 60px;padding-bottom: 60px;"><div class="column is-9 is-12-mobile"> <p>As can be seen, areas to the east of Troost Ave are rapidly being gentrified by so-called “urban renewal” projects: rents are rising, eviction rates are high, and the Black population is being displaced. Therefore, it is significant that ShotSpotter's coverage area includes many neighborhoods slated for redevelopment, as the technology inherently results in increased policing. Research has shown that police presence intensifies in gentrifying areas,<sup><a href = "https://theappeal.org/the-role-of-police-igentrification-breonna-taylor/">[18]</a></sup> which suggests that one purpose of ShotSpotter is to help police render a formerly disinvested and segregated area "safe" for reinvestment and white residents to move in. (In practice, ShotSpotter and policing have not been effective at reducing gun violence: after nearly a decade of partnering with ShotSpotter and a police budget which has grown by 25% since 2012,<sup><a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B6PTyCwpnd4wozXlS9YTmCAyF52PLHvv/view">[19]</a><a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RBelIZLYVtUPE4GzHhpI8rFAlxIk6xdE/view">[20]</a></sup> Kansas City still has record high gun homicide rates.<sup><a href = "https://apnews.com/article/homicide-kansas-city-shootings-violence-crime-52bee5aa18d1d3b5b6f8815d674a945c">[21]</a></sup>)</p><br><p>What this ultimately means, however, is that ShotSpotter exacerbates multiple forms of violence: the hyper-policing of neighborhoods already suffering from gun violence and the displacement of Black residents from their homes. It should not be forgotten that Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, and many other Black women and men have been killed by police against the backdrop of "urban renewal" projects;<sup><a href = "https://theappeal.org/the-role-of-police-igentrification-breonna-taylor/">[22]</a></sup> ShotSpotter increases the potential for these tragedies to repeat themselves yet again in gentrifying neighborhoods in Kansas City and across the over one hundred other cities that use gunshot detection technology. </p><hr><p class="is-size-7">This work has been supported by the Human Rights & Technology Fellowship at MIT's Center for International Studies. </p></div></div></div><script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.js"></script><script src="/dist/JS/scroller.js"></script><script src="/dist/JS/main.js"></script></body></html>
